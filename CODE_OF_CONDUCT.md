# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge  
We as members, contributors, and collaborators of Ooops Studio pledge to make participation in our community inclusive, respectful, and creative—no matter your background, identity, or experience.

## Our Standards  
Positive behaviour includes:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.  
- Asking for feedback, giving feedback, owning mistakes.  
- Working toward what’s best for the creative community, not just what’s best for us.

Unacceptable behaviour includes:
- Harassment, discrimination or exclusion based on identity, experience or perspective.  
- Troll-ish behaviour: insulting, shaming, or purposefully derailing discussion.  
- Publishing private or personal information without consent.  
- Using the pretext of “art” or “provocation” to harm others.

## Scope  
This Code of Conduct applies in all Ooops Studio spaces: GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, in-person or online events, design reviews—any place where we gather under the Ooops name.

## Enforcement  
If you see or experience behaviour that breaches this Code:
- Send an email to **hello@ooops.studio**.  
- Include: a clear description of the incident, links/screenshots if available, and your contact preference (you may remain anonymous).  
- We review all reports, aim for a response within **72 hours**, and may issue: a correction, a warning, suspension or permanent ban depending on severity.  
- We guarantee confidentiality for the reporter and commit to preventing retaliation.
